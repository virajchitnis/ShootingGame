1) Write next level info to file.
2) Implement Weapon ammo and reload.
3) Add graphics to frmGame
4) Implement 'continue game'.
5) Write high scores to file in frmGame.

6) it seems that highscore is saving highscore for a single level. Instead, 
there should be totalpoints variable (add all of the level scores toegether)
this is what should be recorded into Highscores.

7) while reloading, i know that there is message that says "reloading",
but can we display this in the actual game screen, and at a much bigger size?
(maybe font size 36 and in the center of the screen. How about disabling the 
mouse cursor while reloading isTrue(if its not too difficult).
8)a mouse "hover" event that makes info about each gun appear (recommended
by Friedman)

9) menu theme music would be cool.
10) animals images "flip" when they hit the border
11) in my opinion, the Bird is the hardest target to kill (despite being
one shot to kill). I think a bird should be givin the most points.

Bonus
1) Animals walk
