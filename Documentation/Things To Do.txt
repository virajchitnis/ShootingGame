1) Add graphics to frmGame
2) Add change weapon button to endGame and pauseGame
3) Add menu music
4) Flip animal images on target direction change
5) Change animal points on destroy

6) it seems that highscore is saving highscore for a single level. Instead, 
there should be totalpoints variable (add all of the level scores toegether)
this is what should be recorded into Highscores.

7) while reloading, i know that there is message that says "reloading",
but can we display this in the actual game screen, and at a much bigger size?
(maybe font size 36 and in the center of the screen. How about disabling the 
mouse cursor while reloading isTrue(if its not too difficult).

Bonus
1) Animals walk
